# ArcGIS Pro AI Toolbox

## Overview

The ArcGIS Pro AI Toolbox is a Python-based toolbox designed to enhance the functionality of ArcGIS Pro by integrating AI capabilities. This toolbox allows users to interact with AI models, process geospatial data, and generate insights directly within the ArcGIS Pro environment. This is a BYOK (bring your own key) implementation.

## Tools

**Add AI Generated Field**: Add new fields with AI-generated text based on existing attributes and user-defined prompts.

**Get Map Info**: Extract information about your current map into a JSON file, providing context for other AI tools.

**Generate Python Code**: Create Python snippets tailored to your workflows and data context.

**Create AI Feature Layer**: Generate new feature layers using prompts to describe the data you need.

**Convert Text to Numeric**: Quickly clean up inconsistent text formats and turn them into numeric fields.

## Installation

The current implementation requires setting a windows environment variable containing a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
